# MyClean - Complete Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up and run the MyClean application for your university project.

## Project Overview

MyClean is a comprehensive cleaning service booking platform with three types of users:
- **Customers** - Book cleaning services
- **Service Providers** - Offer cleaning services
- **Admins** - Manage platform and resolve disputes

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm (v8 or higher)
- Git

## Quick Start

### 1. Backend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd myclean-backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
# Create a .env file with:
DATABASE_URL="file:./prisma/dev.db"
JWT_SECRET="your-secret-key-here"
PORT=4000

# Run database migrations
npx prisma migrate dev

# (Optional) Seed the database
npx prisma db seed

# Start the backend server
npm run dev
```

The backend will run on `http://localhost:4000`

### 2. Frontend Setup

```bash
# Open a new terminal
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd myclean-frontend

## Key Technologies

### Frontend
- **React 18** - UI framework
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling
- **React Router** - Navigation
- **Axios** - HTTP requests
- **date-fns** - Date handling

### Backend
- **Express** - Web server
- **Prisma** - ORM
- **SQLite** - Database
- **bcryptjs** - Password hashing
- **JWT** - Authentication tokens
- **Zod** - Validation

## Environment Variables

### Backend (.env)
```
DATABASE_URL="file:./prisma/dev.db"
JWT_SECRET="your-super-secret-key-change-in-production"
PORT=4000
```

### Frontend (.env) - Optional
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:4000
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Module not found" errors
**Solution**: Make sure you've run `npm install` in both backend and frontend directories.

### Issue: Database errors
**Solution**: 
```bash
cd myclean-backend
npx prisma migrate reset
npx prisma migrate dev
```

### Issue: Port already in use
**Solution**: 
- Kill the process using the port:
  - Windows: `netstat -ano | findstr :4000` then `taskkill /PID <PID> /F`
  - Mac/Linux: `lsof -ti:4000 | xargs kill`

### Issue: CORS errors
**Solution**: Make sure the backend is running and CORS is enabled (already configured).

### Issue: Tailwind styles not working
**Solution**:
```bash
cd myclean-frontend
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
```
