## Architecture Highlights

### 1. Component Structure
```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/          # Reusable UI components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Navbar.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Modal.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Card.tsx
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ProtectedRoute.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ context/            # Global state management
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ AuthContext.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ pages/              # Route-based pages
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ customer/       # Customer-specific pages
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ provider/       # Provider-specific pages
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ admin/          # Admin-specific pages
â””â”€â”€ App.tsx             # Main routing logic
```

### 2. Authentication Flow
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (CUSTOMER, PROVIDER, ADMIN)
- Protected routes
- Persistent login with localStorage

### 3. Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Fully responsive on all devices
- Tailwind breakpoints (sm, md, lg, xl)
- Modern UI with smooth transitions

### 4. User Experience
- Intuitive navigation
- Clear call-to-actions
- Real-time feedback
- Loading states
- Error handling

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Why React + TypeScript?
- **Type Safety**: Catch errors at compile time
- **Better IDE Support**: Autocomplete and IntelliSense
- **Maintainability**: Easier to understand and refactor
- **Modern Standard**: Industry best practice

### 2. Why Tailwind CSS?
- **Rapid Development**: Build UIs quickly
- **Consistent Design**: Design system built-in
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first utilities
- **Small Bundle**: Only used classes included

### 3. Why Context API?
- **Simple**: Easy to understand and use
- **Built-in**: No additional dependencies
- **Sufficient**: Adequate for app complexity
- **Learning**: Good for university project

### 4. Component-Based Architecture
- **Reusability**: Components used across pages
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear responsibilities
- **Testability**: Easy to test individual components
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new features
