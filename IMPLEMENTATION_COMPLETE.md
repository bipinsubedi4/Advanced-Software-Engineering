## 📝 What Your Team Should Know

### You (Frontend):
```
✅ All frontend features complete
✅ Ready for demo
✅ Need minimal backend additions
✅ Can integrate real APIs easily
```

### Backend Person:
```
⚠️ Basic CRUD done
⚠️ Need additional endpoints (see README_FEATURES.md)
⚠️ Payment webhooks needed
⚠️ File upload endpoints needed
```

### Other Team Members:
```
✨ Frontend is production-ready
✨ Beautiful UI/UX
✨ All features working with mock data
✨ Easy to customize
```

---

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Mock Data:
Currently, most features use mock data. This is **intentional** for demo purposes:
- Provider list (mock)
- Bookings (mock)
- Messages (mock)
- Reviews (mock)

To connect real backend:
- Replace axios calls with actual endpoints
- Update API URLs in code
- Add error handling

### Backend Integration:
Your backend teammate needs to add these endpoints (detailed in README_FEATURES.md):
```
POST /api/providers
GET /api/providers/:id
POST /api/bookings/:id/reviews
GET /api/messages/conversations
POST /api/verification/phone
... and more (see docs)
```

### Environment Setup:
```bash
# Backend needs:
DATABASE_URL="file:./prisma/dev.db"
JWT_SECRET="your-secret-key"
PORT=4000

# Frontend automatically uses:
http://localhost:4000 (proxy configured)
```
